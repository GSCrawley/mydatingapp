# ***ViDate*** #
### *A dating app with integrated video chat* ###

### If you've ever used a dating app to meet people, you know it can be an awkward, at times frustrating experience. ###

For starters it's a forced, unnatural situation that both parties enter into with (usually unrealistic) set expectations. Couple that with the fact that people often misrepresent themselves, intentionally or not (sure, that's a great shot of you from 6 years ago, but do you really still look like that?) and you've got a surefire recipe for a disappointing, potentially humiliating first date situation.

When it comes down to it, it's still a blind date no matter how long you've been text chatting for. Sure, you can chat via text but how accurate a picture of someone can you really get that way? In a face-to-face conversation you get the benefit of body language, facial expressions, chemistry, etc.. 

## **ViDate** 
# cirumvents that uncomfortable first-date that feels like a job interview, by integrating a *Video Chat* feature, allowing people to actually get to know each other a little with a face-to-face conversation before deciding to actually meet in person.

## Dates 3/16-3/25

## My Name: Gideon Crawley

## Project Name: ViDate

## Is your project New or Old? Old

## Is your project Solo or Team? Solo

 ### Description

## Currently the project is just the front-end; it's a mock dating app with a mock log-in page, mock sign-up page, mock profile page (that currently is not even mock-functional), and a mock video chat. What I want to acheive during the intensive is (at least) to be able to create a profile with image and information, store it in the database, and render it on the profile page, as well as build a functional video chat page (or at least a functional chatbox). Further on down the road, once I learn how to do user authentication, I will make the login and signup pages actually work, but I don't think I'll be doing that during this intensive. To make the functional profile page I'll be using python, html, css, flask. To build the video chat I'll be using Flask and Agora.io SDK, following a tutorial.

## Challenges I Anticipate

### I'm going to be learning some new stuff I've never used before
### now that we're doing the intensive remotely, I'm going to have to really be self-motivated - i find it tough to get work done outside of school, so this will be a good challenge for me to structure my time on my own.

## Skateboard

### -CRUD profile page
Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.

## Bike

### - CSS Styling on profile page

## Car
### - Build functional video chat!

## Personal Achievement Goals: 
### Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.

## Teammate 1 Goal 1 - Finish profile page and make it look good ## Goal 2 - build functional video chat Goal 3 - learn how to use APIs
