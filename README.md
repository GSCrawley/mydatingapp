**ViDate** (Winter Intensive Project)

*A dating app with integrated video chat*  


If you've ever used a dating app to meet people, you know it can be an awkward, at times frustrating experience. 

For starters it's a forced, unnatural situation that both parties enter into with (usually unrealistic) set expectations. Couple that with the fact that people often misrepresent themselves, intentionally or not (sure, that's a great shot of you from 6 years ago, but do you really still look like that?) and you've got a surefire recipe for a disappointing, potentially humiliating first date situation. When it comes down to it, both parties are pretty much going in blind. Sure, you can chat via text but how accurate a picture of someone can you really get that way?

ViDate cirumvents the uncomfortable first-date issue by integrating a Video Chat feature, allowing people to actually get to know each other a little with a face-to-face conversation before deciding to actually meet in person.
