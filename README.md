### *A dating app with integrated video chat* ###

This was initially my SPD1.2 final project, however I ended up having to put off completing it because I had an accident. So for the winter intensive project, I'm building the basic front end of the site as I had initially intended, and fleshing out the back end of main element of the website, the **user profile page**. I want to be able to upload a photo and provide the basic dating profile info and a brief bio, and for now, just for the purposes of the intensive, create and show a list of users as well as being able to edit and delete user profiles. 

I have yet to learn User Authentication (as in, actually being able to allow the user to register for the site with a real user name and password), so for now until I do, the login and signup pages, as well as profile and video chat pages, are just mockups to show proof of concept.

### If you've ever used a dating app to meet people, you know it can be an awkward, at times frustrating experience. ###

For starters it's a forced, unnatural situation that both parties enter into with (usually unrealistic) set expectations. Couple that with the fact that people often misrepresent themselves, intentionally or not (sure, that's a great shot of you from 6 years ago, but do you really still look like that?) and you've got a surefire recipe for a disappointing, potentially humiliating first date situation.

When it comes down to it, it's still a blind date no matter how long you've been text chatting for. Sure, you can chat via text but how accurate a picture of someone can you really get that way? In a face-to-face conversation you get the benefit of body language, facial expressions, chemistry, etc.. 

**ViDate** cirumvents that uncomfortable first-date that feels like a job interview, by integrating a *Video Chat* feature, allowing people to actually get to know each other a little with a face-to-face conversation before deciding to actually meet in person.
